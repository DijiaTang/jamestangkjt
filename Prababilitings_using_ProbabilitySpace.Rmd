```{r}
turnoverData <- read.csv('C:/Users/dijia/OneDrive/ND/ITAO 60200 Intro to Bus An/R/Rdemoday/turnoverData.csv')

## Question 1: What is the probability of an employee being over 40 years old?
install.packages("prob")

library(prob)

probabilitySpace = probspace(turnoverData)

Prob_age_over40 <- Prob(probabilitySpace, (age > 40))

Prob_age_over40

## Question 2: What is the joint probability of being over 40 years old and quitting?

Prob_over40quit <- Prob(probabilitySpace, (age>40 & separatedNY == "1"))

Prob_over40quit
  
## Question 3: Using the Bayes Theorem, determine the conditional probability of quitting and being over 40 years old?
  
Prob_quitgivenover40 <- Prob(probabilitySpace,(separatedNY == "1"))

Prob_over40quit/Prob_quitgivenover40

## Question 4: Given the conditional probability found in Question 3, discuss any managerial implications that you see.

## We can see that employees that are over 40 are the majority of the quitters.

## Silver: Find the distribution that would offer a good fit to the age variable.

install.packages('fitdistrplus')
install.packages('dplyr')
library(fitdistrplus)
library(dplyr)

summary(descdist(turnoverData$age))

plot(fitdist(turnoverData$age, distr = 'norm'))

## Normal distribution would offer a good fit

## Gold: Use sample() to create 3 new data frames: data with 100, 250, and 500 rows. 
## Compute the probability of quitting for each sample size and discuss how they differ.
sample1 <- sample_n(turnoverData,100,replace = F)

sample2 <- sample_n(turnoverData,250,replace = F)

sample3 <- sample_n(turnoverData,500,replace = F)

## Probability of quitting of sample1

probabilitySpace1 = probspace(sample1)

prob1 <- Prob(probabilitySpace1,(separatedNY == "1"))

prob1

## Probability of quitting of sample2

probabilitySpace2 = probspace(sample2)

prob2 <- Prob(probabilitySpace2,(separatedNY == "1"))

prob2

## Probability of quitting of sample3

probabilitySpace3 = probspace(sample3)

prob3 <- Prob(probabilitySpace3,(separatedNY == "1"))

prob3


## As the sample size increases, the probability of quitting of the sample gradually approaches that of the population.
